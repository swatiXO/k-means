# k-means
Elbow method for optimal value of K
# Task 1
1. Use iris flower dataset from sklearn library and try to form clusters of flowers using petal
width and length features. Drop other two features for simplicity.
2. Figure out if any preprocessing such as scaling would help here
3. Draw elbow plot and from that figure out optimal value of k

# Task 2
Use given CSV as dataset and figure out optimal value of K.
